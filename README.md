# Topic-Modelling

## Overview
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. It's widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to uncover hidden structures in large datasets of text. The most common algorithms for topic modeling include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

In this repository, we'll demonstrate how to implement topic modeling using Python, specifically focusing on LDA with the gensim library.
